# Night time clock 
A simple clock, with support for a white noise file.<br/>
I host this on a pi on my local network and use an old tablet to connect. 

## To set up on a raspberry pi:
Install apache (sudo apt-get install apache2)<br/>
Clone this repo<br/>
Move these files to /var/www/html<br/>
Connect to the pi<br/>
